      <p>Hi, I’m Alyssa, and this portfolio represents more than just my projects. It’s a reflection of how I see, create, and connect with the world around me. Every piece here tells a small part of my story, my curiosity, my growth, and the things that inspire me to design, explore, and express.</p>
      <p>I’ve always believed that creativity isn’t just about making something look good, but about making it feel right and giving meaning to what we see and experience. Through my work, I aim to bring ideas to life in a way that’s both thoughtful and human. Whether it’s a spatial design, a visual concept, or a personal project, I try to approach everything with intention, blending practicality with imagination.</p>
